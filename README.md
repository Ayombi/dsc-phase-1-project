## Project Overview
In this analysis, I will perform an analysis on a large data set of approximately 73,000
movies from 3 datasets. The data includes many different types of information about each movie, ranging from
the release date, the director, the studio, to other information like the budget, the box office
earnings, the audience and critic scores from different sites. I will analyze this data set to
determine what contributes to a movie being a “success”. For this analysis, I will define success
in financial terms, basing the success of a movie on the amount of money it earns in
comparison to the movie’s budget..

### Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.
